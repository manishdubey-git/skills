3. Read: `{lang}/authentication.md` (getting API key)
4. Read: `{lang}/basic-message.md` (first call)
5. Run: Copy example and test locally
6. Next: Expand to specific features (tools, files, caching)

### Intermediate: "I've used Claude before, adding a new feature"

2. Read: The recommended section for that task
3. Check: **⚠️ API Drift** if it might have changed
4. Implement: Using language-specific examples
5. Debug: Using `{lang}/errors.md` if issues arise

### Advanced: "I need to optimize or use advanced features"

## FAQ

**Q: The SKILL.md is long. Do I need to read all of it?**
A: No. Use this navigation guide to find your specific task. Skim the relevant section; skip the rest.

**Q: I found conflicting info in two places. Which do I trust?**
A: Priority: `{lang}/ specific files > shared/ detailed guides > SKILL.md quick references`.
The more specific the section, the more up-to-date it usually is.

**Q: Can I use OpenAI/Gemini examples with Claude API?**
A: Not directly. The APIs differ. If you need non-Claude providers, Claude API skill will tell you to stop—it only produces Claude/Anthropic SDK code.

**Q: How often is this skill updated?**
A: SKILL.md is the source of truth; it's updated as APIs change.
Individual reference files may be updated more frequently.
Check `shared/live-sources.md` for links to official documentation (always authoritative).

**Q: I'm getting an error not covered here.**
A: Check `shared/common-errors.md` first.
Then check `{lang}/errors.md` for language-specific interpretation.
Last resort: Check the official SDK repository (link in `shared/live-sources.md`).

**Q: How do I choose between different approaches?**
A: Read **SKILL.md § Which Surface Should I Use?**.
Each approach has trade-offs; the section explains when to pick each.
