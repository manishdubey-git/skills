# Web Security Audit Skill (web-security-audit)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A general-purpose web application **security audit** skill: **white-box (source) root-cause analysis + black-box (live behavior) verification + a "negative behavior test" trio** — producing severity-graded risk reports with ready-to-paste fixes.

> Compliant with the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) (initiated by Anthropic). Works with Claude Code, WorkBuddy, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and more.

## Features

- **White-box + black-box combined** — statically inspect root causes (SQLi / XSS / auth / IDOR / CSRF / upload / path traversal / SSRF / info disclosure / dependencies), then verify attacker-observable behavior (status codes, response bodies, SPA fallbacks, sensitive-file reachability) and cross-validate both.
- **Negative behavior test trio** (the core; the part pure static analysis most often misses):
  1. **Malformed inputs on public endpoints** → assert `400/422`, not `500`;
  2. **Sensitive-path probing + `content-type` check** → distinguish SPA-fallback artifacts from real file leaks;
  3. **Unknown-path 404 semantics** → SPA fallback should only match extension-less frontend routes.
- **Runnable probe script** — `scripts/probe.sh <url>` runs the whole trio in one shot.
- **Safety built-in** — authorized targets only; fully non-destructive (no real injection, no brute-force, no data mutation).

## Installation

Agent Skills is an open standard — **the same skill folder works on every platform below**. Unzip `web-security-audit/` into your platform's skills directory:

| Platform | Global path | Project path |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/skills/` | `.codex/skills/` (or `.agents/skills/`) |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/skills/` | `.cursor/skills/` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/skills/` | — |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `.github/skills/` |
| **Windsurf** | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` | `.windsurf/skills/` |
| **Cline / OpenCode / Kimi Code** | `~/.agents/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` (shared) |
| **Trae / Trae CN** | `~/.trae/skills/` | `.trae/skills/` |
| **Qwen Code (Alibaba)** | `~/.qwen/skills/` | `.qwen/skills/` |
| **WorkBuddy** | `~/.workbuddy/skills/` | — |
| Standalone | This repo is the skill itself; `scripts/probe.sh` runs independently | — |

> Paths verified against the Agent Skills ecosystem table (2026-03); always confirm with the platform's official docs. Tip: maintaining a single `.agents/skills/` covers Copilot, Cline, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode and more.

## Usage

```bash
# 1) Negative behavior test (malformed inputs / sensitive paths / unknown paths)
./scripts/probe.sh https://target.example.com

# 2) Full audit flow (driven by an AI agent)
#    recon → white-box pass → black-box pass → negative trio → cross-validation & report
```

**Output:** a severity-graded table (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info); each finding with *symptom / impact / fix code / verification*; and direct answers to questions like *"any backdoors?"* or *"can the database be dumped?"*.

## Safety statement

For **authorized** assessments only (your own projects or written authorization). All built-in probes are harmless verification requests. Never use against unauthorized targets.
