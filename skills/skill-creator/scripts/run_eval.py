"""Run trigger evaluation for a skill description.

Tests whether a skill's description causes Claude to trigger (read the skill)
for a set of queries. Outputs results as JSON.

Mechanism: each run creates an isolated temporary project containing the
candidate description installed as a real skill at
<tmp>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md, and `claude -p` executes with that
project as its working directory. Using the standard skill layout makes
the candidate's installation match the production surface being evaluated.
Running in a throwaway project keeps the skill's real name (no suffix),
never touches the user's project, and makes concurrent runs collision-free
by construction: every run gets its own project directory keyed by a full
UUID4. The directory is shared by the run's parallel workers and removed
when the run ends; directories left behind by killed runs are swept once
they are older than --stale-artifact-hours.

Because user-level skills take precedence over project skills, an installed
~/.claude/skills/<name> would shadow the candidate. The eval fails fast in
that case rather than silently measuring the wrong description or moving
user files.
