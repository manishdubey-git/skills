## How to Use This Skill

1. **Read SKILL.md** for comprehensive guidance (404 lines)
2. **Check references/**:
   - `philosophy-guide.md` — creating algorithmic philosophies
3. **Start with a concept** — what visual do you want to create?
4. **Choose a platform** — p5.js for web, Processing for desktop, Three.js for 3D
5. **Build iteratively** — start simple, add complexity
6. **Share and iterate** — get feedback, evolve the work

## Quick Concepts

### Algorithmic Philosophy
Every generative art piece should have a clear "philosophy" — the core idea or principle that drives it:

❌ **Weak**: "Random shapes"
✅ **Strong**: "Concentric circles grown by a diffusion-limited aggregation algorithm, with growth speed modulated by sine waves"

The philosophy:
- Guides what the code does
- Determines parameters and variations
- Explains artistic intent
- Helps others understand or remix your work

See `references/philosophy-guide.md` for detailed guidance.

### Key Principles

**Intentionality**: Every algorithm choice should serve the visual concept

**Variation**: Parameterize your code so you can explore variations easily

**Aesthetics**: Write code that makes beautiful things, not just correct things

**Efficiency**: Use appropriate data structures; generative art can be computationally expensive

**Control**: Balance randomness with constraints; chaos needs structure

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Randomness with Constraints
```
Start with noise or random seed
Apply rules or transformations
Constrain to artistic bounds
Iterate and refine
```

### Pattern: Iterative Generation
```
Initialize with simple shape
Apply transformation rules
Repeat many times
Layer results with blending
```

### Pattern: Interactive Exploration
```
Set up parameter space
Allow user input to explore
Visualize parameter effects
Save interesting variations
```

## Getting Started: Three Approaches

### Approach 1: Start with Code (For Programmers)
1. Pick a library (p5.js, Three.js, etc.)
2. Read SKILL.md for concepts
3. Code a simple algorithm
4. Iterate on visual output
5. Refine philosophy and parameters

### Approach 2: Start with Concept (For Artists)
1. Describe visual concept in words
2. Read `philosophy-guide.md`
3. Collaborate with Claude to turn concept into algorithm
4. Claude writes code
5. Iterate on both concept and code

### Approach 3: Remix Existing Work
1. Find interesting algorithmic art
2. Understand the underlying algorithm
3. Modify parameters or add variations
4. Create new artwork by tweaking existing philosophy

## Workflow

1. **Concept**: Define what you want to create
2. **Philosophy**: Articulate the core algorithm/idea
3. **Prototype**: Build a minimal working version
4. **Visualize**: Display and evaluate results
5. **Iterate**: Adjust parameters and algorithm
6. **Refine**: Polish aesthetics and add sophistication
7. **Share**: Document and share with others

## Quick Reference: When to Use What

| Need | Use | Library |
|---|---|---|
| Simple 2D sketches | p5.js | JavaScript |
| Static generative images | Processing | Python or Java |
| Interactive web experience | p5.js + DOM | JavaScript |
| 3D visualization | Three.js | JavaScript |
| Real-time animation | Three.js or Shader | JavaScript/GLSL |
| Complex data viz | D3.js | JavaScript |
| Mathematical exploration | Processing | Python |
| Mobile-friendly | p5.js | JavaScript |
| High performance | WebGL/Shaders | GLSL |

## Tips for Success

**Do:**
- ✅ Start with clear artistic intent
- ✅ Use parameters to explore variations
- ✅ Build simple algorithms first, add complexity
- ✅ Test across different seeds/random states
- ✅ Document your philosophy
- ✅ Iterate on both code and aesthetics
- ✅ Share work and get feedback

**Don't:**
- ❌ Treat it as pure programming (it's art)
- ❌ Ignore the mathematics (understand what you're doing)
- ❌ Hardcode values (parameterize everything)
- ❌ Skip the aesthetic refinement (first version rarely looks great)
- ❌ Forget to save variations (they're part of the work)
- ❌ Make it too simple (exploration is half the fun)

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Doesn't look artistic | Refine parameters; add constraints; simplify algorithm |
| Too slow/laggy | Optimize algorithm; reduce resolution; use appropriate data structures |
| Can't replicate results | Use seeds; save parameter sets; document randomness |
| Algorithm too complex | Break into smaller components; visualize intermediate steps |
| Lost artistic intent | Revisit philosophy; clarify what the algorithm expresses |
